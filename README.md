History Of Saree

Saree has existed for almost 5000 years, dating back to the Indus Valley culture (3300-1300 B.C.E.). One of the oldest clothing items still in use today is the Indian saree.

A lot of people think that in the second century BC, Alexander the Great brought this article of clothing to India. Many Greek women in the Mauryan court wore a long piece of fabric called a "Chiton," which was thrown over one shoulder, and the rest was used as a pleated skirt. A large number of Mauryan emperors wed Greek women. This had an impact on South Asia's and India's fashion.

Many Indian goddesses are pictured wearing sarees, and a saree is likewise seen as a tribute to the gods. A traditional dress in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal is the Saree or saree. It is still popular for daily or special wear among Indian women. Indian ladies believe that wearing a saree, jewellery, and a Bindi on her forehead is the epitome of feminity. 

The Traditional Indian Saree

The Sanskrit word "Saadi," which refers to the Sattika fabric type, is where the word "saree" first appeared. Hindu scripture claims that Sattika is the culmination of a three-piece ensemble. This consists of the Stanapatta, a chest band, the Uttariya, a veil worn over the shoulder, and the Antriya, the lower clothing.

This entire ensemble is known as poshak, a general name for a costume. Antaria later developed into the Bhairnivasani skirt known today as the Lehenga or Ghaghra. By the first century, the stanpatta had developed into a bodice, and the northern, uttariya which was worn as a veil over the head now, had become the dupatta.
